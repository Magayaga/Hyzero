# osSystem() method executes the command (a string) in a subshell.
# This method is implemented by calling the Standard C function system() and has the same limitations.
# If the command generates any output, it is sent to the interpreter’s standard output stream.
# Whenever this method is used then the respective shell of the Operating system is opened
# and the command is executed on it.

# osSystem() is similar to the os.system()
