<details><summary>History</summary>

## 1. New programming language of the Asia (2022-present)
Hyzero was created on July 25, 2022, by Cyril John Magayaga. It is the Philippines' first programming language.

The Hyzero documents, design, implementation, and related tools are hosted on GitHub private under the OpinionOne version 2.

**On July 30, 2022**, Cyril John Magayaga said __Hyzero__ was a new programming language like calculator, command language, computer program, and upcoming application.

**On August 5, 2022**, Cyril John Magayaga announced that __Hyzero__ become new high-level and general-purpose programming language, and the Philippines’ first easiest programming languages. The new filename extension on .hyzero is called the source code of a program. 

**On August 6, 2022**, Cyril John Magayaga announced that __Hyzero__ programming languages like __Python__. The _Hyzero 0.1_ was released on __August 15, 2022__, with many major new features.

**On August 24, 2022**, Cyril John Magayaga announced that __Hyzero__ programming language, written in **Python** programming language (High-level, Interpreted, & General-purpose) and **C** programming language (Binary). Not to be confused with [**_Hy_**](https://github.com/hylang/hy) _programming language_ and don't known as **_Zero_** _programming language_. 

__Hyzero__ programming language become **Strong** and **Dynamic** programming language. `.hyzero` was real file extension of **Hyzero**.

### Build of the Hyzero
There are a few languages that have followed this model for other ecosystems, and Hyzero aims to fill an analogous role for Python:

* C → C++
* Visual Basic → Visual Basic .NET
* JavaScript → TypeScript
* Java → Kotlin
* MATLAB → Julia
* Objective-C → Swift
* C++ → Carbon
* Python → **_Hyzero_**
